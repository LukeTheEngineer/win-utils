# win-utils
Windows utility programs to assist Linux users

Are you a dual-boot enjoyer? Do you get confused when running commands, accidentally running Linux commands on Windows? Well, I have the tools for you!

## Build
To build, simply run **make** in the win-utils source directory. Once compiled, you can export the **touch** executable to your environment variables.
Done!
